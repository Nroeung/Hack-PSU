The N-Multi- tool is designed to be a low cost shared Internet of Things (IOT) monitoring system and data systems device. It utilizes an android app programed in Java and a Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi) to seamlessly works together through a web-socket connection. The simplicity is in the RPi, it contains a built in wireless adapter that is set to broadcast a network similar to a router. Here, an android device such as a user’s phone with the N-Multi- tool app can connect and control the RPi remotely and query data from it. The app and RPi also incorporates outside Linux and Java API’s in order to perform effectively and efficiently in terms of its connectivity design. Currently, the N-Multi- tool app only allows users to able to control the on and off state of an LED that is attached to the RPi and query heartbeat data that is sent from the RPi in JSON format. Ideally, this is a starting point and further implementation can be made to this system in terms of it being a shared local computer that can determine if a parking lot is empty or free and as a measuring device such as for monitoring crops.
